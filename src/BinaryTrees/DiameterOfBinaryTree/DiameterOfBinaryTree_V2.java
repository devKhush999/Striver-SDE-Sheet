     * Same Solution without the use of Global Variable
     * We can create an array/object, and update the value inside it using its reference.
     * This will work same as the global variable

     // Same as Before Solution 1
     * Is it possible to optimize the above solution further?
     * Which operation do you think is very repetitive in nature in the above solution?
     * ðŸ’¡ Finding Height of the subtrees.
     *
     * Can we use postorder traversal to calculate everything in a single traversal of the tree?
     * Yes, as in post-order traversal, we have to completely traverse the left and right subtree before
     visiting the root node.
     * So, the idea is to use post-order traversal and keep calculating the height of the left
     and right subtrees.
     * Once we have the heights at the current node, we can easily calculate both th


     * Time Complexity: O(n)
        * All nodes will be traversed only once
     * Space Complexity: O(Height of Tree)
