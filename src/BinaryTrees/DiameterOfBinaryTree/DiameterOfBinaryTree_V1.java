    /********************************* Brute Force **********************************************
     * Intuition:
        * The idea is to consider every node as a Curving Point in diameter.
        * We can define the curving point as the node on the diameter path which has the maximum height
        * Observation: Diameter of the tree can be defined as left subtree height + right subtree height
            from the Curving Point.
        * So, the idea to find the Curving Point is, consider every node in the tree as a curving point
            and calculate the diameter for every curving point and return the maximum of all diameters.

     * Time Complexity: O(N^2)
        * For every node, Height Function is called which takes O(N) time hence for every node
            it becomes N*N
     * Space Complexity: O(Height of Tree)
        * Recursive Stack Space

    /********************************* Efficient Solution : 1 ****************************************
     * Is it possible to optimize the above solution further?
     * Which operation do you think is very repetitive in nature in the above solution?
     * ðŸ’¡ Finding Height of the subtrees.
     *
     * Can we use postorder traversal to calculate everything in a single traversal of the tree?
     * Yes, as in post-order traversal, we have to completely traverse the left and right subtree before
        visiting the root node.
     * So, the idea is to use post-order traversal and keep calculating the height of the left
        and right subtrees.
     * Once we have the heights at the current node, we can easily calculate both the diameter
        and height of the current node, and hence for each & every node.

     * Time Complexity: O(n)
        * All nodes will be traversed only once
     * Space Complexity: O(Height of Tree)
