    /****************************** Efficient "BFS + MinHeap" Solution **********************************
     * Approach & Thought Process:
        * First, we need to assign a vertical and a level to every node.
        * Once we assign them, we need to figure out a suitable data structure to store them.
        * This data structure should give us the nodes with left-side vertical first and in every
            vertical, top-level node should appear first.
        * Idea is to store all the nodes in increasing order of their verticals (vertical no.)
        * For Tree nodes in same Verticals, we store them in increasing order of their Levels (level no.)
        * For Tree nodes in same Verticals & Levels, we store them in order of sorted values
        * If we think carefully, a Priority Queue (MinHeap) can serve this purpose well

     * Steps:
         * We will perform a BFS tree traversal and assign a vertical and level to every node.
         * We also simultaneously add the TreeNodes to Priority Queue, to store them in their
            respective priority.
         * Then, we finally visit all the TreeNode in the required priority (mentioned above) from
            PriorityQueue, add it to the output.

     * Time Complexity: O(2 * n * log(n))  ~  O(n * log(n))
        * We are first doing BFS Traversal for Assigning vertical and level to every node that will take
            O(n*log(n)) time (as we will also add nodes in PriorityQueue as well)
            Normal Level Order (BFS) Traversal takes O(N).
            But here we are pushing into MinHeap â€“ Single push O(LogN). So Overall O(N*LogN).
        * Then we again traverse all the Nodes as per their priority given by PriorityQueue, this
            will also take O(n*log(n)) time.
     * Space Complexity: O(n/2) + O(n) + O(n)  ~  O(n)
        * O(n) Space for Storing all the TreeNodes with their location {Node, vertical, level}
        * O(n/2) for Space required for Queue used in BFS Traversal
            The queue will have max at Last Level O(N/2) = O(N)
        * The heap also stores all the nodes at a point, so O(n).
