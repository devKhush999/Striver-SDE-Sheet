    /************************************* Iterative Efficient Solution *************************************
     * Intuition:
        * In preorder traversal, we print a node at the first visit itself.\
        * Whereas, in inorder traversal at the first visit to a node, we simply traverse to the
            left child. It is only when we return from the left child and visit that node the
            second time, that we print it.
        * Similarly, in postorder traversal, we print a node in its third visit after visiting both
            its children.

     * Approach:
        * We take a stack data structure and push a Pair<node, timesSeen> to it.
        * Here 'node' is the Tree Node and 'timesSeen' the no. of times that node has been visited/seen
        * Initially, the "timesSeen" is 1 as we are visiting the node for the first time.


     * Time Complexity: O(3 * n)
        * Each Node in the Binary Tree will be visited thrice
     * Space Complexity: O(2 * n)
        * We are creating a Stack to store the all the Nodes in the TREE as 'Pairs'
        * Stack can have all the nodes in worst case
        * Each Element of stack will be a Pair (an Object). This will take another O(n) Space
