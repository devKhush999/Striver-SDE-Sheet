     ********************************* Approach 3: Expand Around Center ******************************
     * We observe that a palindrome mirrors around its center. Therefore, a palindrome can be expanded
     * from its center, and there are only 2nâˆ’1 such centers.
     * You might be asking why there are 2n-1 but not n centers?
     *  The reason is the center of a palindrome can be in between two letters.
     * Such palindromes have even numbers of letters (such as "abba") and its center are between the two 'b's.
     *
     * Since expanding a palindrome around its center could take O(n) time, the overall complexity is O(n^2)
     * If we have used string.charAt(i), TC would become O(n^3)
     * Time complexity : O(n^2)
     * Space complexity : O(1)      If we ignore char array & output string
