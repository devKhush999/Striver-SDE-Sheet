    * Problem with this method is that while multiplying the number 'mid' n times in multiply() function.
      overflow may occur in the value of product
    * Time Complexity : O(log(N) * log(M * 10^d))
      log(N) due to because we are finding the "mid^n" using Power Function
      where 'd' is the decimal value till which error is allowed
    * We can also do the same in Time Complexity of O(N * log(M * 10^d)) if we directly
    * multiply 'mid' n times to find 'mid ^ n"
    * Space Complexity : O(1)
