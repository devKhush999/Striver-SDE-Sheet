// PRE-REQUISITE: MEDIAN OF TWO SORTED ARRAYS

/*
 ************************************* Intuition *************************************
* We can part it in such a way that our kth element will be at the end of the left half array.
* Letâ€™s make some observations:
    1) The left portion of the array is made of some elements of both array1 and array2.
       So, divide the merge sorted array into two halves, one of indices from [1, k] and other
       from indices [k+1, m+n]  (1-based indexing!!!)
    2) We can see that all elements of the right half of the array are always larger than the left ones.
    3) So, with help of binary search, we will divide arrays into partitions with keeping k elements
       in the left half. We have to keep in mind that l1 <= r2 and l2 <= r1. Why so?
       This ensures that left-half elements are always lesser than right elements.

    ******************************* Binary Search Solution **************************************
    * Time Complexity : log(min(m,n))
        Reason: We are applying binary search in the array with minimum size among the two.
        Thus, the time complexity of this approach is log(min(m,n)), where m,n are the sizes of two arrays.
    * Space Complexity: O(1)
        Reason: Since no extra data structure is used, making space complexity to O(1).
