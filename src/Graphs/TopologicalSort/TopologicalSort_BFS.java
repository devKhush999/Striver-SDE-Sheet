     * It means linear ordering of vertices such that there is an edge u â€”> v, u appears before v in
       the ordering.
     * INTUITION:
         * The question states that if there is an edge between u and v then u should appear
           before v, Which means we have to start this algo from a node that doesn't have any previous
           edges. But how to find that node that has no edge before if?
         * Here, we use the concept of in-degree (Number of edges pointing toward a node).
           We use the in-degree concept to find topological sorting
         * In the topological sort vertices with 0 in-degree appears at the first and the vertices
           with highest in-degree appears at the last.
         * In general, in topological sort, all the vertices appear in the increasing order of
           their in-degree.

     * Time Complexity : O(V + E)                Same as BFS for Graph with adjacency list
     * Space Complexity: O(2 * V) = O(V)         Same as BFS for Graph with adjacency list
