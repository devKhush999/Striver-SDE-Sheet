    /*
      INTUITION:
    * An efficient solution is to use the Greedy approach.
    * The basic idea of the greedy approach is to calculate the ratio value/weight for each item
      and sort the item on basis of this ratio.
    * Then take the item with the highest ratio and add them until we canâ€™t add the next item as a whole
      and at the end add the next item as much as we can.
    * This will always be the optimal solution to this problem.

      APPROACH:
    * The greedy method to maximize our answer will be to pick up the items with higher values.
    * Since it is possible to break the items as well we should focus on picking up items having
      higher value per unit weight first. To achieve this, items should be sorted in decreasing order
      with respect to their value per unit weight.
    * Once the items are sorted we can iterate. Pick up items with weight lesser than or equal
      to the current capacity of the knapsack.
    * In the end, IF the weight of an item becomes more than what we can carry,
      break the item into smaller units and take only that much weight which is required. (in order to
      maximize the values of boxes).
      Calculate the value corresponding of chosen weight (divided unit/weight) according to its
      current capacity and add this new value to our answer.

    * Time Complexity: O(n*log(n)) + O(n) ~ O(n * O(n * log(n)).
      O(n.log(n)) to sort the items and O(n) to iterate through all the items for calculating the answer.
    * Space Complexity: O(1), no additional data structure has been used.
