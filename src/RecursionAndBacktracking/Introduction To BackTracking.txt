- Brute Force approach finds all the possible solutions and selects desired solution per given the constraints.
- Dynamic Programming also uses Brute Force approach to find the OPTIMUM solution, either maximum or minimum.
- Backtracking also uses Brute Force approach but to find ALL the solutions.
- Solutions to the Backtracking problems can be represented as State-Space Tree.
- The constraints applied to find the solution is called Bounding function.
- Backtracking follows Depth-First Search method.
- Branch and Bound is also a Brute Force approach, which uses Breadth-First Search method.

Backtracking is an algorithmic paradigm that tries different solutions until finds a solution
that “works”.
Problems that are typically solved using the backtracking technique have the following property in common.
These problems can only be solved by trying every possible configuration and each configuration is
tried only once. A Naive solution for these problems is to try all configurations and output a
configuration that follows given problem constraints. Backtracking works incrementally and is an
optimization over the Naive solution where all possible configurations are generated and tried.
